# Kanban Board: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View

## Overview

In this project, you will dynamically display tasks from the **given initial data** 
on the DOM using JavaScript. Tasks should be placed into the correct **Kanban board columns** 
based on their status, and clicking a task should open a **modal** where users can view and modify 
task details. The project emphasizes **DOM manipulation, event handling, modular JavaScript structure, and 
responsive UI implementation.**
